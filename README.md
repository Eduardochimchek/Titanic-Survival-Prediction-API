# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-API
Predict Titanic passenger survival using ML models. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, with three classification models compared. A REST API is implemented to receive passenger data via POST requests and return survival predictions (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived).
